Idea: Rougelike mod! (Need to think of a name)

To do:

Pillars (randomly spawn around world, give blessing when right clicked, i.e. Blessing of the Miner, +25% Mining Speed)
Unmarked potions
Figure out what mobs I want to give levels and attribute bonuses
Figure out what items I want give stats and variation

Started:

Pillars model.

Done:

Basic stat system for mobs and items
