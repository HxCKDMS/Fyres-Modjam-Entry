Idea: Rougelike mod! (Need to think of a name)

To do:

Add more blessings to pillars
Figure out what mobs I want to give levels and attribute bonuses
Figure out what items I want give stats and variation
Give items stats when taken from creative inventory

Done:

Basic stat system for mobs and items
Pillars (randomly spawn around world, give blessing when right clicked, i.e. Blessing of the Miner, +25% Mining Speed)
Unmarked potions (Each new world you make selects 12 potion types and durations. Drink a mystery potion to find out what it does permanently in that world!)
