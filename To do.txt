Idea: Rougelike mod! (Need to think of a name)

To do:

Add more blessings to pillars
Figure out what mobs I want to give levels and attribute bonuses
Figure out what items I want give stats and variation
Give items stats when taken from creative inventory

Done:

Traps (Can only be seen within 5 block radius while crouching, does damage to players and hostile mobs that touch it, can be disarmed by right clicking)
Dungeons spawn 13x as often
Basic stat system for mobs and items
Hostile mobs get levels (+5 hp per level, +5 additional for level 5)
Pillars (randomly spawn around world, give blessing when right clicked, i.e. Blessing of the Miner, +25% Mining Speed)
Unmarked potions (Each new world you make selects 12 potion types and durations. Drink a mystery potion to find out what it does permanently in that world!)
