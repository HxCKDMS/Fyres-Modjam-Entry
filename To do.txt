Idea: Rougelike mod!
Name: You Will Die Mod

To do:


Add more blessings to pillars
Figure out what mobs I want to give levels and attribute bonuses
Figure out what items I want give stats and variation


Done:

Traps (Can only be seen within 6 block radius while crouching, does damage to players and hostile mobs that touch it, has small chance to poison, can be disarmed by right clicking)
Can disable traps in the properties file

Dungeons spawn 13x as often

Hostile mobs get levels (+5 hp per level, +5 additional for level 5)
Level 5 mobs get a blessing (Ranged mobs: Hunter or Swamp, Non-ranged Mobs: Warrior or Swamp)

Bows, Axes, and Swords get a random rank and bonus damage, along with a random prefix

Pillars (randomly spawn around world, give blessing when right clicked, i.e. Blessing of the Miner, +25% Mining Speed, pillars of your current blessing will slightly glow and emit particles)
Use x button on pillar to see what blessing they have.

Blessings: 

    Miner - +25% mine speed on stone and iron blocks,
    Lumberjack - +25% mine speed on wooden blocks,
    Warrior - +25% melee damage,
